 VR4300SIM: A MIPS (NEC) VR4300 simulator.
==============================================================================

To my knowledge, this is the first-ever open-sourced implementation of a
cycle-accurate model of the VR4300.

This simulator is a work in-progress. It has been designed such that it is
completely self-standing, and only requires a C99/C++0x compiler. Support for
additional features (i.e., SSE) are added where possible, but have been
conditionally defined in order to support platforms not capable of supporting
those features natively.

Most of this work would not have been possible without the years of effort
put in by most of the community. I have simply refined whatever findings that
I've found. I owe much of the progress I've made to others; and for that, I
thank you. You all know who you are.
