All donations can be made via PayPal: tylerjstachecki@gmail.com.

Unless the community has heftier pockets than I, all donations will likely
go towards improving emulation (i.e., purchasing an N64 drive and other
hardware). As of right now, I only own a limited number of carts and a single
console that I picked up off eBay.

If you or anyone you know has an Indy with a U64 board, I'd be more than
willing to make an offer on such a historical device. Please message me with
serious inquiries if you or anyone you know would be willing to part with one.
